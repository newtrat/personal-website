# personal-website

My repo for my li'l [personal website](http://nickyannacone.com).

As much as I can, I'm trying to do this "on my own," without helpful libraries,
because I want to see what it's like and have fun (or "fun") doing it.

Todos:
- Make ball movement in terms of time, not JS ticks... or at least take
longer between ticks. Currently it's really hitting the browser hard,
especially on phones.
- Make the website readable on a phone. No need for game, though it'd be cool
if it could use phone tilt.
- Add a bio.
- Get some more readable styling. White on black is a little harsh.
